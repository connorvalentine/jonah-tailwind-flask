''' This is  empty right now. __init__ files are weird
I could delete this, but I wanted to include a blank one so you could see it. 

They are commonly used to initialize variables and functions that will be used in
other scripts that are in the same folder as the init file.

There is also some magic with making python packages... but I dont understand it fully. 

Just know that init.py files exist and people use them.
