## Create your virtual environment 
All instructions from here : https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment 
 - open up a new terminal in VSCode
 - change directory to the github folder (tailwind-flask)
 - into the terminal run the follwing commands while you are in the tailwind-flask folder: 

 1. python3 -m venv env 
    - this creates a clean env folder. It will make a copy of python here that we will use only for this project
 2. source env/bin/activate
    - we tell vscode that all python commands will be for our env folder now
 3. python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    -  I made a requirements.txt file which we can use to tell python the EXACT packages (add ons) that need to be installed into our python env folder. This way everyone on the team is running exactly the same software. It works nicely.

- you are now ready to run python for this project :)

## install tailwind.css 
 - you actually don't need to do this right now because I included the full tailwind in our gtihub repo.
 - first install npm. Which is something I dont really know what it is. Its kinda like pip, but for javascript things. 

 npm install -g npm

 Now follow the directions in tailwindREADME to get a full copy of tailwind on your machine
